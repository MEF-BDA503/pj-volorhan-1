# The Progress Journal

## Week 3 (Oct 24)

+ The data set that I propose to use in my project is "Aircraft Crash Data". [Here](hw2.html) is the data and my initial exploratory data analysis on it.

+ We decided on the groups. Our group name is **NYC** and other members are:

  + [Volkan ORHAN (Me)](https://mef-bda503.github.io/pj-volorhan-1/)
  
+ A report that is prepared by our group members about Mef University’s place among its competitors and in the undergraduate market according to the university entrance examinations (YGS/LYS) can be reached in our [group page](https://mef-bda503.github.io/gpj-nyc/).
